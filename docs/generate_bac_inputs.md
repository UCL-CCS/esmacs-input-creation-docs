## Combine ligand and protein PDBs



### Solvent

## Add header

Additionally, a BAC specific header should be included at the top of the file.
This simply contains the number of protein chains included.

```
REMARK   6 PROTEIN CHAINS 1
```

As the PDB format is based on columns the `REMARK   6 PROTEIN CHAINS ` section (up to the figure for the number of protein chains) must be reproduced exactly.
